# History Browser

The goal of the history browser project is to provide a visual front end to our knowledge of historical figures, using wikidata as the backing store of knowledge.

## Goals

1. Show me the people you know about in a given time period and geographic range, in a useful interactive interface.
2. Allow me to add / edit that database -- using wikidata as the system of record.

## Design

### UI

- [ ] Sketch the desired UI (it's close already)

### Sync service

- [ ] Link to open wikidata (1) to a specific person (2) general search
- [ ] Ability to kick off ingesting a given QID 
- [ ] Ability to review all recent changes an ingest them for known QIDs
